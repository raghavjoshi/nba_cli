# NbaStatsCli
### Built by Raghav Joshi

## Description
This project was built for CIS-196 during the Spring of 2017. The purpose of this
project was to build a CLI tool for NBA statistics. This "Stat Tracker" gives the
user the ability to find stats/information about a player, team, and find
live/past/upcoming games.

## Installation
* Install the gem with `gem install nba_stats_cli`
* Execute `nba_stats_cli` to run the program

## Usage


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
